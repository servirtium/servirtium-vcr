## [Recording rules]

What the test asked Servirtium to leave out or rewrite when it wrote this recording; everything else is as sent. Playback does not read this section.

| Rule | Applies to | Matching | Written as | Interactions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| removed | response headers | `Date` | (left out) | 0–6 |
| removed | response headers | `X-Request-Id` | (left out) | none |
