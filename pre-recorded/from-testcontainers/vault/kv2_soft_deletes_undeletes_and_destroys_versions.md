## [Recording rules]

What the test asked Servirtium to leave out or rewrite when it wrote this recording; everything else is as sent. Playback does not read this section.

| Rule | Applies to | Matching | Written as | Interactions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| removed | response headers | `Date` | (left out) | 0–12 |
| removed | response headers | `X-Request-Id` | (left out) | none |

| redacted credential | request and response headers | `X-Vault-Token` | `X_VAULT_TOKEN_N` | 0–12 |

A credential's `N` numbers each distinct value: the same value has the same number wherever it appears, and one of 8 characters or more is replaced in bodies and paths too. Playback matches credential headers on presence, not value.
