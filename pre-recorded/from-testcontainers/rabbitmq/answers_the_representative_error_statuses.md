## [Recording rules]

What the test asked Servirtium to leave out or rewrite when it wrote this recording; everything else is as sent. Playback does not read this section.

A credential's `N` numbers each distinct value: the same value has the same number wherever it appears, and one of 8 characters or more is replaced in bodies and paths too. Playback matches credential headers on presence, not value.
